# Region Codes

Based on the [ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) standard.

Region codes are generated by taking the 2 or 3 character region code from the ISO 3166-2 standard, transforming them to hex, and concatenating the hex values. The resulting code is stored in bytes3 so is padded right where necessary.

Example:

    iso3166 = "US-AL"[3:]
    iso3166 = [hex(ord(i)).replace('0x','') for i in iso3166]
    print(''.join(iso3166)).ljust(6, '0'))

Becomes:

* Country US
* Region 414c00
